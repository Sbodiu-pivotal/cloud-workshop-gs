## Test hello world application

1 Change to the lab directory:

    $ cd hello

2 Build the application:

    $ gradle assemble

3 Run the application:

    $ java -jar build/libs/hello-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Pushing to Cloud Foundry

1 Inspect the manifest _manifest.yml_:

    ---
    applications:
    - name: hello
      memory: 512M
      instances: 1
      host: hello-${random-word}
      path: build/libs/hello-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

2 Push to Cloud Foundry:

    $ cf push
    ...
    1 of 1 instances running
    
    App started
    
    
    OK
    
    App hello was started using this command `CALCULATED_MEMORY=$($PWD/.java-buildpack/open_jdk_jre/bin/java-buildpack-memory-calculator-1.1.1_RELEASE -memorySizes=metaspace:64m.. -memoryWeights=heap:75,metaspace:10,stack:5,native:10 -totMemory=$MEMORY_LIMIT) && SERVER_PORT=$PORT $PWD/.java-buildpack/open_jdk_jre/bin/java -cp $PWD/.:$PWD/.java-buildpack/spring_auto_reconfiguration/spring_auto_reconfiguration-1.7.0_RELEASE.jar -Djava.io.tmpdir=$TMPDIR -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=$PWD/.java-buildpack/open_jdk_jre/bin/killjava.sh $CALCULATED_MEMORY org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher`

# Spring Cloud Services

This guide walks you through the process of registering and consuming a simple "hello world" REST service with *Eureka* and *Hystrix* on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
You'll deploy the simple "hello world" REST service created to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, register it to a Eureka service instance, and then write a client that discovers and consumes the service.

## Enable the discovery client

1 Change to the lab directory:

    $ cd greeting-service
    
2 Starting with the "hello world" REST service, you'll start by enabling the service for service discovery.
  Modify the initial code to enable support for external configuration through the use of the Spring Cloud Services starter.
  Modify the Maven POM to replace the Spring Boot parent with the Spring Cloud Services parent.
  The next thing to do is to add the Spring Cloud Services Service Registry starter to the build:
    
3 The Spring Cloud Services Service Registry starter adds the Eureka discovery client to the project so that the service can automatically register itself and periodically renew its registration with a Eureka server. The starter also adds the Spring Cloud Pivotal connector, which enables the application to connect to the Eureka server as a service that is bound to the application in Cloud Foundry.  
  Next, you'll need to enable the discovery client by annotating `DemoApplication` with `@EnableDiscoveryClient`.
  The `@EnableDiscoveryClient` annotation enables a Eureka discovery client that will register the "hello world" REST service with the bound Eureka service so that other applications can discover and consume it.
  
  By default, the service will be registered in Eureka as "bootstrap". But since this name is too generic to be of any practical use, you'll want to set the `spring.application.name` property so that the service will be registered with a meaningful name. You can do that by creating an `application.yml` file with the following entries:
  
  `src/main/resources/application.yml`
  
  That's all of the changes necessary to enable the "hello world" service for service discovery in Eureka. Next you'll deploy the service to Pivotal Cloud Foundry and bind it to the Eureka service.

      Once the application has been built, you can deploy it to Cloud Foundry using the Cloud Foundry command line interface (cf CLI):
