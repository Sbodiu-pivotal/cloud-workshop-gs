# Spring Cloud

Spring Cloud builds on Spring Boot by providing a bunch of libraries that enhance the behaviour of an application when added to the classpath.
You can take advantage of the basic default behaviour to get started really quickly, and then when you need to, you can configure or extend to create a custom solution.
Let's get started with Spring Cloud and Build our Cloud Native Application sample

## Spring Cloud  Starter

Spring Boot-style starter projects to ease dependency management for consumers of Spring Cloud.

1 Change to the lab directory
 
    $ cd cloud-services    
    
2 Inspect pom.xml    

    <parent>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-parent</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.2.RELEASE</version>
        <relativePath/>
    </parent>

3 Build the project:
    
    $ mvn package
    
## Spring Cloud Config 

Spring Cloud Config Server Features:
* HTTP, resource-based API for external configuration (name-value pairs, or equivalent YAML content)
* Encrypt and decrypt property values (symmetric or asymmetric)
* Embeddable easily in a Spring Boot application using @EnableConfigServer

Config Client features (for Spring applications):2
* Bind to the Config Server and initialize Spring Environment with remote property sources
* Encrypt and decrypt property values (symmetric or asymmetric)

1 Change to the cloud config directory
    
    $ cd configserver 

2 Run this project as a Spring Boot app, e.g. import into IDE and run main method, or use Maven:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

3 It will start up on port 8888 and serve configuration data from "https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/config-repo":

    $ http://localhost:8888/demo/default


Resources

Path	Description
/{app}/{profile}	Configuration data for app in Spring profile (comma-separated).
/{app}/{profile}/{label}	Add a git label

## Spring Cloud Service Discovery

Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice based architecture.
Trying to hand configure each client or some form of convention can be very difficult to do and can be very brittle. 
It's based on Eureka Netflix OSS product, Spring Cloud Netflix features:
                                   
* Service Discovery: Eureka instances can be registered and clients can discover the instances using Spring-managed beans
* Service Discovery: an embedded Eureka server can be created with declarative Java configuration

1 Change to the eureka directory

    $ cd eureka
     
2 Run this project as a Spring Boot app, e.g. import into IDE and run main method, or use Maven:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run
        
3 It will start up on port 8761 and serve the Eureka API from "/eureka".
 
    $ http://localhost:8761/

Resources

Path	Description
/	Home page (HTML UI) listing service registrations
/eureka/apps	Raw registration metadata

## Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker

It's based on Hystrix Netflix OSS product, Netflix has created a library called Hystrix that implements the circuit breaker pattern.
In a microservice architecture it is common to have multiple layers of service calls.
Having an open circuit stops cascading failures and allows overwhelmed or failing services time to heal.
The fallback can be another Hystrix protected call, static data or a sane empty value.

Spring Cloud Netflix features:

* Circuit Breaker: Hystrix clients can be built with a simple annotation-driven method decorator
* Circuit Breaker: embedded Hystrix dashboard with declarative Java configuration. Dashboard displays the health of each circuit breaker in an efficient manner.


1 Change to the hystrix directory

    $ cd hystrixdashboard
    
2 Run this project as a Spring Boot app, e.g. import into IDE and run main method, or use Maven:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run
    
3 If you run from this project it will be on port 7979 (per the application.yml).
On the home page is a form where you can enter the URL for an event stream to monitor: 

    $ http://localhost:7979
